<h4> This script is designed to check the status of a local git repository and compare it with the remote repository. It displays the active branch,, local changes, recent commits, last 5 commits, and any differences between the local and remote repository. </h4>

<h3> Requirements: </h3>
<h4> No special requirements other than python and git, all the libraries used are built-in python libraries, so all that is needed is Python 3.x and git for its commands. But incase any of the libraries are not installed the list of libraries is: tkinter, os, subprocess, sys, socket </h4>
<h4> You can install these libraries using pip3 install library_name command in your terminal</h4>

<h3>How to use: </h3>
<h4>1. Download the script and navigate to it using the terminal and run the command "python3 main.py" </h4>
<h4>2. Select the git directory you want information on from the dialogue box that appears and you are done! </h4>
<h4>3. The Script will then display the following information: Active branch, Local changes, Recent Commits, Last 5 commits, If there are any differences in local and remote repository </h4>

<h3> Notes: </h3>
<h4>1. If the script does not detect a valid git repository, it will ask you to select a different folder. </h4>
<h4>2. If there is no internet connection, the script will not check the remote repository and will display. Message “No Internet connection, skipping the remote repository check!”.</h4>
