Pronto.aiA script for getting the status of your local repository and get other information like recent commits, if the commit was done by a particular user called “Rufus”.The script prompts the user to enter the local directory path of the Git repository, and then uses the subprocess module to run several Git commands in the specified directory.The script first runs the command git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree to check if the entered directory is a valid Git repository. If the command returns a non-zero exit code, the script prompts the user to enter a new directory path.Once a valid Git repository is found, the script runs the following commands:* git status --porcelain to check if there are any local changes in the repository* git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD to get the name of the active branch* git log -1 --pretty=format:"%an" --since="1 week ago" to get the author name of the last commit in the repository made in the last weekThe script then prints out the active branch, whether there are local changes, whether the author of the last commit in the last week is "Rufus", and whether there is a recent commit.You could use this script in your local git repository to check if any changes are made by Rufus and also check recent commits.
